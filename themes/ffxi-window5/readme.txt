Version 1.0

Theme in the style of FFXI's Window 5 UI made for the Balloon addon.

Created using assets copied from Altana Viewer, edited together in GIMP.

Transparency added by me because I couldn't get the original files, I had to screenshot them. Might be a little different from the game's.

Advance prompt is styled after the "next page" triangle that appears when viewing items/equipment with long descriptions. The orange "crystal" icon that appears in the game's chat log didn't look right, and couldn't be animated properly when I made this, so I ditched it. I included the alternate version I experimented with though, just in case someone might want to use it.

I also tried making a version with a gap in the frame for the npc text, but since you can't adjust for the npc's name it never looked quite right and it made adjusting the size/position of the name an absolute nightmare. I included that version too just in case.

I play with 2560x1440 resolution and /balloon scale 1.5. You might have to adjust things a bit to get it looking right for your setup.


Thanks for reading and using my theme :)
